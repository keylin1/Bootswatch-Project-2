### aka. Dream Diary âœ¨

### About
This project is made for my MMART167 class as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap practice. The contents contain articles about my dreams rewritten into scripts. The entries are categorized and presented as snippets from different dream scenarios.

### Navigation
The diary is organized into several dream entries, each accessible through the navigation menu:

- **Home**: Overview of the Dream Diary.
- **Silent Sanctuary**: A dream entry set in a zombie-infested apocalypse where silence and quick thinking are key.
- **Victorian Escape Room**: A harrowing Victorian nightmare where the protagonist orchestrates a daring escape.
- **A Journey Through Worlds**: A dream journey through familiar school halls, surreal events, and a majestic outer space kingdom.

## Dream Entries
Each dream entry is presented as a card, containing details such as the title, date, and a brief description of the dream scenario. Users can click on "Enter" to explore each dream entry in detail.

## Footer
The footer contains information about the website creator, Ke Lin, along with a contact option.
